Exo Political Theory

This mod contains a new technology and a new building:

Exo Political Theory: Our classical political theories must be updated to account for alien psychologies.
Exo Affairs Institute: An institute of public and private specialists to coordinate our external affairs and spread our values and influence.  Due to the need to be close to the seat of the government, it can only be built at our capital.

The Exo Affairs Institute is limited to one on the capital planet.
