# Exo Political Theory

This mod is based on [Test23456](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=848053326) [Influence Generator](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=848053326) mod but has been adjusted to focus soley on influence generation.

This mod contains a new technology and a new building:

Exo Political Theory: Our classical political theories must be updated to account for alien psychologies.

Exo Affairs Institute: An institute of public and private specialists to coordinate our external affairs and spread our values and influence.

The Exo Affairs Institute is limited to one per planet, costs 5,000 minerals to construct, and basically converts 2 energy credits into 1 influence point per month to a maximum of 3 influence points per month.  It also adds two administrator jobs to the planet.
