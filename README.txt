[h1]Exo Political Theory[/h1]

This mod is based on [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=848053326]Test23456[/url] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=848053326]Influence Generator[/url] mod but has been adjusted to focus soley on influence generation.

This mod contains a new technology and a new building:

[b]Exo Political Theory:[/b] Our classical political theories must be updated to account for alien psychologies.

[b]Exo Affairs Institute:[/b] An institute of public and private specialists to coordinate our external affairs and spread our values and influence.

The Exo Affairs Institute is limited to one per planet, requires a population of 10, costs 5,000 minerals to construct, and basically converts 2 energy credits into 1 influence point per month to a maximum of 3 influence points per month.  It also adds two administrator jobs to the planet.
